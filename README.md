# IP Subnetting Implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of *IP Subnetting* using *Cisco Packet Tracer*.  
The main purpose of this project is to divide a large network into multiple smaller subnets to improve network performance, security, and efficient IP address utilization.

This project is designed for *computer networking students* to understand practical subnetting concepts through simulation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand the concept of IP Subnetting
- To design a network using multiple subnets
- To configure IP addresses manually
- To verify connectivity between devices
- To gain hands-on experience using Cisco Packet Tracer

---

## 🛠 Tools & Software Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Windows Operating System
- GitHub (for project hosting)

---

## 🌐 Network Topology
The network topology consists of:
- Routers
- Switches
- PCs (End Devices)

Each subnet is connected logically using routers to allow communication between different networks.

---

## 📋 Device List
- Router(s)
- Switch(es)
- PC(s)
- Ethernet Cables

---

## ⚙ Implementation Steps
1. Design the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer  
2. Assign IP addresses based on subnetting calculation  
3. Configure router interfaces  
4. Configure IP addresses on PCs  
5. Enable routing between subnets  
6. Save and test the configuration  

---

## 🧪 Simulation & Testing
- Ping tests were performed between devices of the same subnet
- Ping tests were also performed between different subnets
- Successful replies confirmed correct subnetting and routing configuration

---

## ✅ Results & Discussion
- All devices successfully communicated within and across subnets
- The project verified the correct implementation of IP subnetting
- Network efficiency was improved through proper IP address allocation

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates *IP Subnetting Implementation* using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It helps in understanding real-world network design and subnetting concepts practically.
